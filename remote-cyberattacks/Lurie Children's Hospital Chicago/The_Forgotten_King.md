[Reddit Profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Forgotten_King/) The_Forgotten_King seems to be a student at UIChicago who worked at Lurie Children's Hospital as a scribe. It's unknown whether or not he was at Lurie Children's during the outage, but here's what he has to say about the layoffs at the hospital.
- [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1fn3u7i/comment/logz2y7/) "I work as a scribe here, and am getting laid off in October. Odd coincidence seeing this as I randomly pass through the subreddit. All I've heard is:
	- Layoffs are happening all over the place, no specifics regarding department or position. Based on what I've personally seen it seems to be mostly administrative staff and assistants and less in the way of residents/attendings, but that's just in my area. Haven't heard any of the docs mention anything about getting laid off themselves.
	- There are no plans for a Northwestern acquisition, despite any rumors that might abound.
	- Per one attending I work with, the hack and associated downtime isses cost the hospital about 2 months worth of revenue (ouch)
  
  Good luck."
