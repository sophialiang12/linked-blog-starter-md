[HIPAA Journal](https://www.hipaajournal.com/january-2024-cyberattack-on-lurie-childrens-hospital-affects-792k-individuals/) On January 31, 2024, Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, IL experienced a cyberattack that took IT systems offline, including
- Epic Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems
- MyChart Patient Portal

Hospital staff had to work by hand to record patient information while EHR was down. On May 20, 2024, access was restored, and manually recorded information had to be put back into the EHR system.
