Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of United Health, detected a ransomware attack on Feb 21 2024. Change provides technology used to submit and process billions of insurance claims every year.
- According to the updated breach report submitted to the HHS' Office for Civil Rights (OCR), the protected health information of **190 million individuals** was compromised in the ransomware attack ([HIPAA](https://www.hipaajournal.com/change-healthcare-responding-to-cyberattack/#:~:text=The%20Change%20Healthcare%20data%20breach%20is%20the%20largest%20ever%20reported,compromised%20in%20the%20ransomware%20attack.)) which occurred due to a lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
- Up to 6TB of data (personal info, payment details, insurance records) was stolen ([Hyperproof](https://hyperproof.io/resource/understanding-the-change-healthcare-breach/))
	- The breach froze day-to-day conduct and delayed treatments and payment of providers: hospitals were unable to "provide patient care, fill prescriptions, submit insurance claims, and receive payment for the essential health care services they provide," says president of American Hospital Association ([HealthJournalism](https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2024/04/the-impact-of-the-change-healthcare-cyberattack-what-to-know/)) 
- Change claimed they would have their operations back by mid-March but ended up extending their restoration past April 29 ([HealthJournalism](https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2024/04/the-impact-of-the-change-healthcare-cyberattack-what-to-know/))

## Suspected Actor
- LPHV/BlackCat claimed responsibility of the attack on Feb 26
	- Demanded and received a ransom of $22 million in bitcoin ([SecurityWeek](https://www.securityweek.com/second-ransomware-group-extorting-change-healthcare/#:~:text=In%20late%20February%2C%20roughly%20one%20week%20after,records%2C%20and%20other%20types%20of%20sensitive%20information.)). For context, UnitedHealth, the parent company, reported $22 billion in profits in 2023 ([HealthJournalism](https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2024/04/the-impact-of-the-change-healthcare-cyberattack-what-to-know/)).
- In April 2024 another group RansomHub (same as OneBlood attacker) started publishing what it claims are files of sensitive patient data stolen during the February breach, demanding ransom from Change ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/change-healthcare-stolen-patient-data-ransomhub-leak/))
	- UnitedHealth says they would "investigate claims posted online to understand the extent of potentially impacted data"

- Change began issuing notifications to customers in June 20 2024 (until December 2024), almost four months after the attack ([HIPAA](https://www.hipaajournal.com/change-healthcare-responding-to-cyberattack/))

### Impact on Physicians
- UnitedHealth loaned $4.4 billion to help providers who lost revenue but those providers then felt "pressured" to make positive statements about UnitedHealth to the public for their support ([HealthJournalism](https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2024/04/the-impact-of-the-change-healthcare-cyberattack-what-to-know/))
- In June 2024 the federal court in Minnesota centralized 50 lawsuits into a class action litigation ([GarfunkelWild](https://garfunkelwild.com/insights/update-on-change-healthcare-class-action-litigation/)) on two main tracks: one for patients whose information was leaked, and one for providers whose payments/reimbursements were delayed/denied
	- ex: [[Fairview Health Services]]
	- Change filed motion to dismiss all the claims seeking damages for the exposure of sensitive data, saying that the company does not operate in the state and the vast majority of plaintiffs don't reside in the state ([HIPAA](https://www.hipaajournal.com/change-healthcare-responding-to-cyberattack/))  - the court will hear and rule on this motion in June 2025
