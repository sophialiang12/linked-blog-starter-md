* From [NBC](https://mynbc15.com/news/local/springhill-medical-center-allegedly-hacked-again): employees are worried about the safety of their personal info, can't access computer system at work
	- "It's scary for us because of our information," says a source - and employee tells NBC **they have been warned not to talk about this issue**
	* "It's effected everything in the hospital, payroll, nothing works, no computers work everything is confusing. It's terrible. Everything is haywire,"
	* "No, it's not a virus. Last week, they installed a new system. It was immediately hacked again," they say.
* From [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileAL/comments/1bvmmpn/a_mother_whose_infant_was_fatally_injured_during/): "The Dr involved in this isn’t shady at all. I was one of her patients at the time this happened. Hospital should have immediately notified anyone who would’ve been affected. Medical records requests were held up for months (I worked in personal injury law at the time and found out about the hack) and I don’t even think the medical record personnel knew how big of a deal it was. I think initially staff thought it was a data breach"
	* [[EtTuAaron]]: "i worked there during the attack. you couldn’t look up a patient’s drug allergies, or their airway history if they were having surgery. it was a complete shit show. and it went on like this at some level for months."
