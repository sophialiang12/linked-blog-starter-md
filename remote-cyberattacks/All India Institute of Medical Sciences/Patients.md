"I'm trying to book an appointment since the day this happened :(" [reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/z734vw/hackers_demand_rs_200cr_in_cryptocurrency_from/) 

[Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/zaqrrc/how_messed_up_is_the_aiims_situation_and_how_no/) expressing outrage over lack of action from the government to address the attack
- "It has been 8 days and neither has the govt done anything or called in CERT-In to take a look into the cluster fuck of a mess a single employee of this hospital created."
- "What’s frightening is the poor cyber sec in our government institutions. Anyone who has worked in infosec has horror stories about government sites. I don’t know what would happen if we get into a war with china. They have a very robust hacking scene and with our security infra we are awfully exposed"
