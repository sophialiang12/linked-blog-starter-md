[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/zsv4no/sickkids_hit_by_ransomware_attack/) comments were very upset and enraged: "this is pure evil" "Who does a thing like that?"
- [Perspective of an IT worker](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/zsv4no/comment/j1dj1p7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) : "I deal with health care clients. Hospital system can be very old, ... Most of the time, you need stupid employees to fall into the bait for it to work. Email phishing is most common way. Health care workers are not I.T. people, they are extremely easy target for Phishing" 
	- "Data management is another issue. If a hospital is heavily relied on Excel or files for critical information, either stored locally or on shared drive, Ransomware will encrypt them in no time once the person take the bait. Software with offline capability (not always connected to internet but later sync with sever) is vulnerable to Ransomware because of local database."

All employees were provided education on cybersecurity in which we learned billions was lost due to cyber attacks on hospitals around the world. **Healthcare is actually preferred target because there's such desperation to restore systems and save live**s. People interviewed have said that **when they told hackers that lives were at stake, the attackers just laughed and said pay up**."

The apology might not have been out of sympathy but more of a business move:

I would say business sense. … They could have simply have decided that this attack really wasn’t a good idea because it would make it harder for them to collect ransoms in the future,” Callow said. “Companies just aren’t going to want to be seen to be financing a group that attacks kids hospitals.”

Criticism of Canadian government not taking cybercrime seriously, compared to the US:

And we can’t afford it. Because at the end of the day you know who’s paying for our lapse in our security? Children with cancer. In Newfoundland it was adults with cancer. … It is our most vulnerable Canadians,” “If there’s anything that’s sacred across this country that we can all unite behind consistently, it’s universal access to health care. Well, guess what falls apart if your hospital is hacked?”"
