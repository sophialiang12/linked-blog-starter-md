## Suspected Actor
[[LockBit]] - a criminal gang and the malware it produces that blocks user access to files and systems in exchange for a ransom payment
* One of its affiliates, that it sells its malware to, had attacked the hospital and LockBit later released an apology and offered a free decryptor

## Perspectives 
* lots of [[public backlash]]
* Patients experiences? Worker experiences?
