## Suspected Actor
[[LockBit]] - a criminal gang and the malware it produces that blocks user access to files and systems in exchange for a ransom payment
* One of its affiliates, that it sells its malware to, had attacked the hospital and LockBit later released an apology and offered a free decryptor

## Perspectives 
* lots of [[public backlash]]
* Patients experiences? Worker experiences?

## Thoughts 
- big emphasis on the ransomware gang apologizing for targeting the hospital and released a decryptor for free [article](https://www.canhealth.com/2023/01/04/cyber-criminals-apologize-for-attacking-sickkids/) [article](https://www.sangfor.com/blog/cybersecurity/lockbit-ransomware-gang-apoloigizes-for-cyber-attack-on-sickkids-hospital)
