Then when the system is up, they’ll see if they overpaid or underpaid us, and if they overpaid then they’ll come after us for the money 😡"

There seems to be no system in place yet for paper charting. Today was absolutely horrific, and I fear for my license. I’m told we could be on paper for months. I only started this job in January, but I am seriously contemplating quitting over how unsafe this is. Paper charting is fine, but not when it’s not how you were trained and when there isn’t an organized system in place for it."
