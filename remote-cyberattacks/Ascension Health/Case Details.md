# Scope
[HIPPA Journal](https://www.hipaajournal.com/ascension-cyberattack-2024/) The threat actor breached 5,599,699 patient records, making it the third largest healthcare data breach of 2024. Breached data includes
- Personal information
- Medical information
- Payment information
- Insurance information
- Government identification

Threat actors did not have access to EHR, so full medical histories were not touched. However, many victims are worried about potential identity theft and fraud.

[Fierce Healthcare](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/systems-clinical-operations-interrupted-ascension-amid-apparent-cybersecurity-event) Some victims of the outage have sued Ascension for negligence in implementing industry-standard cybersecurity practices, arguing that the attack could've been preventable.
