Only certain computers were working up until 4 when the whole system went down. We frantically converted to paper charting, all documentation is now in patient binders. The pyxis doesn’t update so pharmacy sends us printed MARs. Our unit had two rapids and it was so chaotic with a breakdown of communication. We had no phone usage aside from landlines and disaster phones. We ended up using our personal phones because we can’t just sit around waiting for multiple calls. Multiple departments are closed due to the outage.

Some docs were trying to give us verbal orders to put in ourselves like usual and we’re like bro do you see what’s happening right now. The straw broke the camel’s fucking back and we’re all suffering now. Patients are being diverted to other hospitals because we can’t operate like this (not to mention our hospital just had a basement flood this week)

I’m scared for my patients and my license. It took me 6 hours to get my pt transitioned to comfort care and get morphine orders. I can’t follow up with docs now because communication is so clogged up.

I left work feeling frustrated and powerless about the system. My only relief was venting to my coworker about our shit day with 20 mcnuggets and 2 large fries."
