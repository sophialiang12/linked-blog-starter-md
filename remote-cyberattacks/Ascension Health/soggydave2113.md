Oh god…also an ascension employee, and yesterday was fucking miserable. Not because of the charting but because the chaos that ensued when there was absolutely no plan B. We didn’t even have our paper charting available to us until about 5pm because no one really knew where it was. Same for order placing and lab/pharmacy requests.
There were a million things that were a clusterfuck yesterday, so here’s to hoping that “months” isn’t accurate.
That being said, that was day 0. I have 5 days off, I’m sure processes will smooth over, but yikes. Yesterday sucked."
