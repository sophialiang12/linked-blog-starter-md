[News18](https://www.news18.com/india/indias-biggest-data-leak-so-far-covid-19-test-info-of-81-5cr-citizens-with-icmr-up-for-sale-exclusive-8637743.html) The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) data leak is the largest data leak in India's history. On October 9th, 2023, 815 million Indians had their data for sale on the dark web.

According to sources reported by News18, foreign actors are involved with the data breach. Furthermore, the leak has not been identified to be part of the Covid-19 test data sent to the Indian National Informatics Centre, Ministry of Health, and ICMR.
# Public Reactions
This attack is less relevant about a hospital breach and outage, but rather a data leak of Indian residents speculated to be from the ICMR. As a result, the public reaction was more geared towards the widespread data breach.

[The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/experts-urge-union-govt-to-be-transparent-about-icmr-data-breach-probe) [Twitter/X](https://x.com/AITCofficial/status/1719241507440570693) The [[All India Trinamool Congress]], a political opposition group, questioned the commitment to the current government's commitment to data security and named ministers responsible for citizens' online security.

[Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedstatesofindia/comments/17jxgks/comment/k74xh69/) In response to a post about the data leak, a now-deleted Redditor posted
> wow mera desh digital hu chuka hai openly jaha koi bhi aake apna data chura leta hai.........Jai Hind.

which translates to
>Wow my country has become digital open where anyone can come and steal their data.........Jai Hind.

This is in reference to the push towards Aadhaar being widely used for anything financial for Indian residents.

[Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/17juy77/indias_biggest_data_leak_so_far_covid19_test_info/) In this thread, many Redditors have been dissatisfied with the cybersecurity infrastructure for Indian residents. Users such as [[OverratedDataScience]], [[Samarium_15]], and [[Possibility-Puzzled]] voiced their grievances.

Other users are angry about Aadhaar being used as a national identifier, such as [[AsliReddington]].
# Attribution and Attack Vector
[Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/indias-biggest-data-breach-hacking-gang-claims-to-have-stolen-815-million-peoples-personal-information) This attack is attributed to a threat actor known as pwn0001, who posted the leaked data for sale on the hacking site Breach Forums.

According to the threat actor, the group exfiltrated the data from information of Indian citizens submitted to ICMR for Covid-19 tests. ICMR has not confirmed the breach.

The vulnerability was discovered by Sourajeet Majumder, a security researcher involved in bug bounty hunting, on an Indian government website. The website leaked Indian resident information, and by mid-October, the vulnerability was fixed.

## Context
[Resecurity](https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/pii-belonging-to-indian-citizens-including-their-aadhaar-ids-offered-for-sale-on-the-dark-web) Aadhaar is a identification number for Indian residents, which includes biometrics such as 10 fingerprint scans and 2 iris scans. Aadhaar can help with electronic payments, online verification, and other Indian financial abilities.

[The Wire](https://cms.thewire.in/tech/indians-personal-data-breached-yet-again-but-no-sign-that-gaps-will-be-plugged) Aadhaar identification has been linked to the personal data of many Indians in the internet, and with a handful of databases with large-scale data of Indian residents, it's difficult to find the extent of the attack and which database is breached. As data sharing spreads further among Indians through Aadhaar, the scale of data breaches could increase, which could lead to an increase in fraud.
