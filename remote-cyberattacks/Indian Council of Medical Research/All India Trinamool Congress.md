The official account for the All India Trinamool Congress, an Indian political party, wrote a Tweet in response to the Aadhaar data breach.

"In a massive Aadhaar data breach, personal identifiable information of 81.5 crore Indians has been leaked on the dark web. This is not the first data breach. In June, personal details of ALL vaccinated Indians had been leaked.

Why, PM @narendramodi , are citizens left exposed and vulnerable to such data breaches when your government touts its commitment to ironclad data security?

How did your Government and @AmitShah 's @HMOIndia remain blissfully unaware? Why were the people not promptly informed about the potential risks to their personal information? And for how long will the incompetence of Cabinet Minister @AshwiniVaishnaw and MoS @Rajeev_GoI of @GoI_MeitY be ignored?"
