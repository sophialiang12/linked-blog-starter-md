OneBlood, non-profit blood donation organization, operates in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, NC and SC
- Started July 26 2024, attack disabled the system that allows OneBlood to quickly label and distribute blood. OneBlood reported that it was able to return to normal distribution after 10 days.
	- had to manually label blood products, so delivery of blood to over 250 hospitals was significantly slowed ([source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/cyberattack-oneblood-blood-donation/index.html)) -> had postponed surgeries 
		- other blood blanks have manual labelling for downtimes but OneBlood never had a manual labelling system before this ([according to reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/medlabprofessionals/comments/1eg9us8/comment/lfuznbo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))
- Names and SSNs were stolen and for a 2 week period certain files and folders were copied from their network without authorization ([source](https://therecord.media/oneblood-breach-report-regulators-privacy))
	- only reported that 281 people in Maine were impacted, OneBlood actually left out the part of reporting form about how many total people were affected by the breach 
- “We have implemented manual processes and procedures to remain operational. Manual processes take significantly longer to perform and impacts inventory availability. In an effort to further manage the blood supply we have asked the more than 250 hospitals **we serve to activate their critical blood shortage protocols** and to remain in that status for the time being,” said Susan Forbes, senior VP for the nonprofit.

	- [Forbes](https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/cyberattack-on-oneblood-put-lives-at-risk-as-more-than-80-of-the-nations-platelets-were-sent-to-florida-during-outage): “Something that may take 30 seconds to label a blood product, may now take 5 or 6 minutes"
	- Significantly impacted Type O blood and platelets since they only have shelf life of 5 days, and they're in highest demand by hospitals
		- platelets are used in surgeries and procedures

- [patient on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/medlabprofessionals/comments/1eg9us8/any_other_south_east_bbs_having_fun_with_oneblood/): "My hospital is still restricting platelets and type o rbc's (red blood cells) to only priority 1 patients. Need approval on dispensing anything. Currently at my hospital we need pathologist approval to dispense any platelets and any Type O rbc. Patients must have clear need and be priority 1, so non-emergency surgeries and transfusions have been pushed back"
